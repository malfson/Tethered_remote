# Tethered_remote
FLEX PROâ„¢  8 TETHERED CAN-BUS CONTROLLER 

Here are some interface functions that i came up with for starting  software design:

initialize_timers() - This function will initialize any timers that are required for the system. This may include timers for button presses, LED flashes, or other timing-related functions.

three_button_authentication() - This function will implement a three-button authentication system to ensure that only authorized operators can control the system. It will prompt the operator to press a sequence of buttons in order to authenticate their identity.

read_led_status() - This function will read the status of the LED output indicator and return the current output level (25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%).

reset_authentication_status() - This function will reset the authentication status to require a new authentication sequence from the operator.

track_speed() - This function will track the speed output of the system and provide updates to the operator as necessary.

initialize_GPIO() - This function will initialize the GPIO pins on the system to ensure that they are set up correctly for use with the tethered remote.
